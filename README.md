# marnorace-the-game

MARNORACE - a fantastic new NFT-based Play-to-Earn game designed by the Marnotaur protocol team. Explore brand new way to use your heroes from the MÆRⴼTΩR NFT collection, earn money and get real pleasure from its exciting gameplay! MARNORACE is a board game based, turn-taking strategy where players combine skills with tactics and rely on a little luck! The game utilizes $TAUR, the Marnotaur platform’s native token, in a unique way.  

In MARNORACE, players bet with $TAUR tokens on whether their NFT champ can finish first in the dangerous race filled with traps and events. One by one, players throw the dice and move across the board to get to three fire capsules. But here’s the catch - two of them are defective! Marnotaurs who will reach the working capsule first take the whole bank (minus a small fee).

Don't expect the path to be easy, your champ can lose his gold or even his life in this quest for treasure! In the end, only the luckiest one receives the huge boost to his initial holdings. Don’t be discouraged if that’s not you, the game contains special events that can help you earn additional $TAUR tokens. MARNORACE - is a new profitable use case for Marnotaur NFTs!

MARNORACE is developed by the Marnotaur team. Marnotaur is a liquidity protocol for secure under-collateralized margin trading. It is fully compatible with any other DeFi protocol and network, enabling traders, farmers and keepers to multiply their gains.
